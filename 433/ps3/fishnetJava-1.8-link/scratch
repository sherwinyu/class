not rewrite it
send(int destAddr, Packet packet)
Call this method to send a packet you have
constructed to a node with destAddr
  How do I know the destination’s
  address?
  Fishnet assign the lowest unused address (0-254)
  to a newly started node
  If you start two fish nodes, they will have address
  0 and 1
Node.java
  onCommand(String command)
  entry point for node commands, process
  commands here
  Example: 0 hello
  Node 0’s onCommand gets invoked with
command = “hello”
Node.java
  onReceive(Integer from, byte[] msg)
  Entry point for receiving a packet
  However, put your support for new protocols in
  receivePacket(int from, Packet packet)
  receivePacket(int from, Packet packet)

Call your protocol specific packet processing code
from this method
Node.java
addTimer
An example of how to use callbacks and
timers
 You may need to implement more
sophisticated versions of it, since the
current one only adds callbacks with no
arguments
